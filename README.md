# ECM 2423 Coursework

## How to run
 
 - If in Terminal, navigate to ECM2423Coursework directory.

 - For algorithm of choice type the specific command
        'python DFS_Search.py' 
        'python BFS_Search.py'
        'python AStar_Search.py'

 - It gives a prompt to enter maze file name 
        Example: "maze-Easy.txt"
    You can either choose from the existing mazes in the 'Mazes' subdirectory, 
    or you can add your own mazes in the same format and add it as a .txt file 
    to the 'Mazes' subdirectory.

 - This will print data to the terminal and should create two subdirectories : 'Paths' and 'VisualPath'

## Where to look for results

 - The statistics are printed in the terminal. 

 - Paths are printed into .txt files in a directory 'Paths'. 

 - The path is printed onto the maze in a .txt file in the subdirectory 'VisualPath'

## Disclaimer

 The printing of the Visual Path/ path on the maze will take time for 'maze-VLarge.txt'
